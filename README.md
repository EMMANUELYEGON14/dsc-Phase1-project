# Phase 1 Project Description

## Project Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data (1962-2023) to identify trends, risk factors, and insights for business recommendations. Using Python and data visualization tools, we explore accident frequencies, aircraft categories, and phases of flight with the highest risk.

### Business Problem

Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### The Data

In the `data` folder is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.



Key Findings

Aviation accidents peaked in certain decades and show a declining trend.

Some aircraft categories have higher accident involvement.

Certain flight phases (e.g., takeoff and landing) account for a majority of accidents.

Visualizations

The analysis includes various data visualizations, such as:

Histogram: Aviation accidents over time.

Bar Charts:

Top aircraft categories involved in accidents.

Most common phases of flight during accidents.

Aircraft categories with the lowest accident rates.

Tools Used

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis

Tableau Public: Interactive Dashboard (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emmanuel.yegon1774/viz/Phase1Project_17429344058460/Dashboard1)

Results

The cleaned and analyzed dataset is saved as Analyzed_AviationData.csv for further exploration.
